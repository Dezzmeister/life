# Life

This is a mobile app that lets you create "quests" for various real-life tasks.
When you create a quest, you assign some XP to it. When you complete a quest,
you get the XP you assigned to it, and you make progress towards the next level.

You start at Level 0, with 100 XP required to get to Level 1. The XP required for
each level is a geometric series where the ratio between terms is 1.05.

1. Add a little game with "items" that can be obtained by leveling up
2. Add a cool animation when you level up
